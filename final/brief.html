        <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>I've decided to update my Mad Libs game for my final project. This project was enjoyable for me and was engaging to many of my friends.</p>

        <p>My primary focus will be on improving the design and usability. Although the site's functionality is solid, its design feels cluttered and could benefit from a refresh. I aim for a more subdued aesthetic, incorporating additional graphics and some animations to make it visually appealing. Furthermore, I plan to keep the background elements muted to add more graphics that resonate with the Y2K theme. I've also noticed that a few participants were unfamiliar with Mad Libs, prompting me to include instructions to help newcomers navigate and comprehend the game more easily. This addition will ensure users know exactly what to do upon visiting the site.</p>

        <p>I plan to present my ideas and seek feedback from various designers, including the undergraduate tutor, a professor, and designers outside of class. Additionally, I will conduct user testing outside of class with peers from the Guardian Scholars Program, among whom I've observed a lack of familiarity with Mad Libs.</p>
