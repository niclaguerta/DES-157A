                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

                <h3>Why and how is this image interesting?</h3>
                <p>This image is interesting because it's my cat Ke$ha. She's very girly and doesn't mind wearing accessories. I chose this picture because who doesn't love cats.</p>
                <h3>How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</h3>
                <p>The topic of my project is to showcase Ke$ha's different accessories. She has many hats that she wears, and I plan on showing them to the world. Honestly, I probably could be making money off of this on social media.</p>
                <h3>How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?</h3>
                <p>I've had Ke$ha since she was a kitten, and no she is 13 years old. She's learned to tolerate my shit over the years, including me dressing her up in different outfits and giving her different hats. To be fair, she doesn't seem to mind them. I usually brush her after I dress her up, and she loves to be brushed</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>What is this image about?</h3>
                <p>This cat is being a very bad boy (I'm guessing), but he doesn't seem to think so. His did something bad, and is being reprimanded, but he's being smug and defensive in response.</p>
                <h3>What are the most interesting aspects of this image? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.</h3>
                <p>The most interesting aspect of this image is his expression. He very clearly doesn't believe he did anything wrong. However, mom disagrees, and he doesn't like that he's being punished for "no reason". He has a lost to say about it.</p>
                <h3>What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of this image?</h3>
                <p>Poobies did something bad. That's the most obvious. Otherwise, there would be no plastic utensil being pointed at him. The most mysterious part is the clip art of a bow. Why is Poobies wearing a bow? Who knows? But I also wonder what Poobies did wrong. How did he get into this situation?</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-02-12">February 12, 2024</time>

                <p>The site I chose to analyze was <a href="https://otoh.agency/">Otoh</a>. Several images on the site feature a small child engaged in an action that is being thwarted by a much larger person. In one image, a child is depicted throwing a basketball toward a hoop, while a disproportionately large hand seems poised to block or flick the ball away with just a finger. The use of scale and perspective crafts a compelling visual metaphor, potentially alluding to various interpretations, such as the obstacles one may encounter while striving to attain a goal, with the large hand symbolizing barriers or interference. The minimalist background, devoid of additional context, directs the viewer's focus to the interaction between the child and the hand, thereby intensifying the scene's drama. This image could serve multiple purposes, conveying a message about surmounting challenges, or as an artistic expression intended to prompt contemplation on themes of perspective, power, and ambition. Upon further research, I learned that Otoh is an omnichannel creative agency driven by possibility, collaboration, and global expertise. The image was part of a campaign for the launch of basketball player Zion Williamson.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-01-31">January 31, 2024</time>

                <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</a> by Naema Baskanderi provides a comprehensive overview of modal windows' utility, design considerations, and best practices for ensuring user-friendly interfaces. Modals, initially celebrated for their simplicity and efficient use of screen space, have evolved into a ubiquitous element in user interface design, often to the user's dismay due to their intrusive nature.</p> 
                <p>Baskanderi emphasizes the importance of modals in capturing user attention, gathering user input, and presenting additional information, either in context or independently from the parent page. However, the article advises against using modals for displaying error, success, or warning messages, suggesting these should remain on the page to avoid disrupting the user experience.</p>
                <p>Key recommendations include providing an "escape hatch" for users to close modals easily—through a cancel button, close button, escape key, or clicking outside the window—and ensuring modals are accessible, particularly through keyboard controls. The anatomy of an effective modal is detailed, stressing the need for a descriptive title to maintain context, clearly labeled buttons to avoid confusion, appropriate sizing and positioning to retain context without dominating the screen, and initiating modals through user actions to prevent unexpected disruptions. The article also highlights the challenges modals pose on mobile devices, where screen real estate is limited, and suggests reconsidering their use in such environments.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, while modals serve significant functions in web design by focusing user attention and simplifying interfaces, their implementation demands careful consideration of user experience, accessibility, and context. Baskanderi's article serves as a valuable guide for designers aiming to balance the benefits of modals with the need to maintain an unobtrusive and user-friendly interface. The checklist provided at the end encourages a thoughtful approach to modal design, ensuring they are used effectively and only when truly beneficial to the user experience.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices: Form Design</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-01-25">January 25, 2024</time>

                <p>In his piece for the UX Collective, Salim Ansari gives us insights on the critical role of forms in driving conversions on websites and apps. He shares 20 best practices for form design, emphasizing the importance of user experience, which can be read here: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design.</a></p>
                <p>Optimizing form design is crucial for enhancing user experience and increasing conversion. Key practices that Ansari points out include reducing the number of input fields to essential information, preferring a single-column layout for faster processing, and dividing large forms into multiple steps to lessen cognitive load.</p>
                <p>It's suggested to start with simpler questions, clearly differentiate between optional and mandatory fields, and provide clear instructions for fields requiring specific formatting. Other recommendations include positioning labels above input fields, avoiding inline labels, using placeholder text wisely, sizing fields appropriately, and being cautious with default values.</p> 
                <p>The article also advises on auto-focusing the first input field, minimizing dropdown menus in favor of radio buttons or checkboxes, ensuring tab navigation compatibility, matching mobile keyboards to input types, explaining the need for sensitive information, offering a 'show password' option, creating clear action buttons, and making forms accessible to all users.</p>
                <p>After reading the article, I found that the newly redesigned <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">FAFSA application site</a> is a prime example of these best practices in action. It demonstrates the effective application of these principles, notably in how it minimizes input fields to only essential information, simplifying the process for users. The site's layout, predominantly single-column, facilitates quicker and more intuitive navigation. Furthermore, the FAFSA form is segmented into clear, manageable steps, reducing the cognitive load for applicants.</p>
